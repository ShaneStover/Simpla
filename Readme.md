# Simpla Programming Language

Simpla is a new programming language designed to be simple and user-friendly, much like Python, but without the more complex or annoying parts. It combines the ease of use found in languages like Python with a more streamlined, less verbose syntax. Simpla aims to provide developers with a clean and straightforward way to write code, focusing on ease of learning and productivity.

## Features

- Simple Syntax: Clean and intuitive syntax designed for both beginners and experienced developers.
- Mathematical Operations: Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations (e.g., NOT).
- Variable Declarations: Allows easy assignment and manipulation of variables, including numbers, text, and boolean values.
- Structures and Instances: Simple ways to declare and use structures, creating instances and accessing their fields.
- Input/Output: Functions for reading from the console and printing values, supporting all variable types.
- Control Flow: Implements basic control flow with easy-to-use `if-then` statements.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.x or higher) must be installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation
